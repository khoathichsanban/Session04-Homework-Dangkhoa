        <p style="color: blue;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to
            format
            the layout of a
            webpage.</p>
        <p class="p1">With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of
            text, the
            spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid
            out,
            what <br> background images or background colors are to be used,
            different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and
            much
            more!</p>
        <p class="p2"><strong> Tip: </strong>The word
            <strong>cascading</strong>
            means that a style applied to a
            parent
            element will also apply to all children elements within the
            parent.
            So, if you <br>set the color of the body text to "blue", all
            headings,
            paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also
            get
            the same color (unless <br> you specify something else)!</p>
